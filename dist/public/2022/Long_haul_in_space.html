                            Most asteroids in our Solar System are really far away from Earth. The
                            bulk of asteroids (in the nearest asteroid belt) are at least as far
                            away from Earth as Earth is from the Sun. That's just too much fuel to
                            spend by current measures. We are much better off capturing asteroids
                            that are flying by, but even for those you need a lot of fuel to
                            get them into Earth orbit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course the exact amount of fuel needed would vary greatly depending
                            on how far away an asteroid is, how big it is and what its current
                            trajectory is. I'm not in a position to make any estimates on
                            the amounts of fuel but some things are slowly becoming more clear.

                            The bigger the more quality
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Last week we got confirmation of the fact that
                            <a href="https://phys.org/news/2022-07-insights-surface-asteroid-bennu.html">
                                the smaller the asteroid the more debris it will contain
                            </a>. I'm going to make an assumption that the value of the material to
                            be mined for a small asteroid will therefore be less not only due to the
                            smaller quantities of the material but also due to lower quality of the
                            ore to be gained for the asteroid.
                        </p>
                        <p>This is purely based on the assumption that debris is less likely to
                            be of a higher density per gram of matter than the solid core of the asteroid and
                            on the recorded fact (in the above article) that the color brightness of
                            the matter was higher beneath the debris. At this point I have very little
                            information to base assumptions on but, based on these few facts, it makes
                            sense to say that digging through a bigger asteroid will have higher chances
                            of being more profitable than digging through the same amount of material
                            on a higher number of smaller asteroids.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Spend it well</h2>
                        <p>
                            It only makes sense that going after "the big fish" will be cheaper in terms of
                            fuel costs than going after lots of "small fry". You just make one round trip
                            and get yourself a sizable amount of matter to work with. This also works
                            better for establishing an anchor point of a space elevator and puts in the
                            right type of machinery and procedures to catch the killer asteroid we are all
                            dreading (if you are acutely aware of the threat).

                            work pretty well for getting payloads into orbits but they will probably not
                            provide the necessary thrust to get to a passing asteroid and alter its
                            trajectory enough to put it into

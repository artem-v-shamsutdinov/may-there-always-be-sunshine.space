                            Building <a href="./Finding_rocks.html">asteroid detection networks</a>
                            is a very large and expensive undertaking. A small group of
                            enthusiasts around the planet might be motivated enough to make it their
                            life's work, but it will be hard for the planet to get going on this, simply
                            because we don't know if a large asteroid will strike Earth this century
                            or even this millenia. But there other factors to motivate us to get
                            this done sooner rather than later.

                            Humanity is starting to run out of resources it can
                            economically extract from Earth. What we are really short on are
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare-earth_element">
                                rare earth minerals</a> used during manufacturing
                            such of high-tech goods like batteries and computer chips. There are
                            asteroids that have
                            <a

                                them and other precious comodities</a>, <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_belt#Composition">

                                lots of them</a>. The issue that
                            stands in the way of large scale investment in mining asteroids is
                            <a href="https://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2016/finalwebsite/solutions/asteroids.html">
                                cost
                            </a>.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Not that expensive
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            But worries about cost are coming from the point of view of sending
                            rockets into space. Well the times are changing. For a while now we've
                            had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_thruster">ion
                                thrusters</a>. They use comparatively little amounts of propellant and work well
                            over longer periods of time. What if we could scale them up? That requires
                            two things: getting more propellant into space and getting more electricity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And it so happens that we are now entering the Age of Energy
                            Abundance. Big money is pouring into development of commercial fusion
                            reactors. The old style tokamaks and stellarators have improved and a vast
                            array of new approaches is being tried. To see for yourself
                            <a href="https://beyond-decentralized.world/blog/">follow the
                                links</a>
                            below the pictures in posts of this site. We are now at the
                            Cambrian explosion of fusion technologies and (as we are all aware) are
                            very motivated to get them working.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next critical piece is to get fusion working in space. And I
                            believe we will <a href="https://www.avalanche.energy/">solve that
                                issue</a> as well, and quickly.

                            Getting propellant to (and resources from) orbit is a harder
                            task. Rockets are expensive and unreliable. They are getting better but
                            fundamentally you have to burn lots of fuel to get much less payload
                            into space. Returning form space is currently a dangerous task.
                            Fundamentally rockets are not a sustainable, long term solution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The perfect solution to this issue has been known to us for a while -
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator">space
                                elevators</a>.
                            The science behind them is pretty simple and there are
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#Orbital_stability">
                                two stable equilibrium points</a> on the globe that will
                            make it feasible to get started (one near the Galapagos and one not
                            too far from the Maldives).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are really two things that are needed for space elevators
                            to work. An a good counterweight and good materials for the thread.
                            Our materials science is now getting <a href="https://phys.org/nanotech-news/">
                                virtually daily</a> improvements. I believe that soon we
                            will have the materials light and strong enough to run the length of the
                            elevator.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And a perfect counterweight is the asteroid to be mined itself.
                            We just have to invest enough into anchoring the first one and
                            everything will be streamlined from there because from that point on we'll be able to use
                            the first Space Elevator for delivering cargo into space. For initial delivery
                            <a href=https://www.space.com/starship-super-heavy-rocket-launch-pad-move-june-2022-photos">
                                soon we will have</a> the tech to get the needed equipment <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship">
                                into space</a> in large quantities in an economical way.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Good for the planet
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Mining asteroids is both profitable and good for the
                            environment. Once space elevators are in place, delivering materials to and from
                            orbit will be both economical and eco-friendly. To begin with we just have to invest a
                            bit more into capturing asteroids that are already flying by, instead of
                            going all the way to the nearest asteroid belt to get them. We need to
                            detect them well before they get near Earth, with enough time to get
                            the thrusters to them to park them nearby.

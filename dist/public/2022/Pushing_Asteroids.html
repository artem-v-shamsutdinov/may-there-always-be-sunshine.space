                            Once we find an earth bound asteroid (
                            <a href="./Getting_Enough_Time.html">with enough lead time</a>
                            to change its trajectory) how do we get there and how do
                            we push it to where we need it to be?
                        </p>
                        <h2>It can be done, now (almost)</h2>
                        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_rocket">
                                Fusion Rocket</a> may be a great eventual solution but
                            at this point it's just a theoretical technology. What if we
                            start mining asteroids next (or even this) decade?</p>
                        <p>Well, chemical rockets aren't nearly as inefficient as they
                            used to be. They still burn lots of propellant but they
                            are now doing it at a much cheaper cost. Thus we are finally
                            at a point where a profitable investment in a rocket (big
                            enough to get to an asteroid and carry enough payload to push
                            it) for the purpose of asteroid mining is within reach.
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship">
                                Space X Starship</a> rocket should be cheap enough to operate
                            to get the necessary equipment and propellant into orbit where it can
                            sit ready for deployment to a nearby asteroid.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Blowing up is not a solution.
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            What about altering the asteroid's trajectory? Previously we have
                            envisioned using powerful explosives to break up a large asteroid.
                            And while that might be good enough to prevent a collision (though
                            ultimately still too unpredictable to be safe, as it might
                            set the bulk of an asteroid on an even worse trajectory) it is no
                            good for putting an asteroid in Earth orbit, for the purpose
                            of mining it.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Just push it
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Well, with enough propellant we should be able to construct a rocket
                            that is not only good enough to get to an asteroid in time but also
                            carries enough propellant to attach to an asteroid and controllably
                            (perhaps over a number of times) park it (or at least prevent a
                            collision with earth). It's really just a matter of getting
                            enough equipment and fuel to the asteroid. And that's ultimately
                            just a matter of time and cost.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Getting material down to Earth
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Then that only leaves the question of how to get mined material
                            down to Earth. Once an asteroid is in orbit we'll have the anchor
                            we need to initially set up a space elevator. What we need are
                            materials strong enough and light enough to actually anchor it
                            to the ground. I, of course, have no idea when we'll get them,
                            but I trust that we will obtain them at the right time.

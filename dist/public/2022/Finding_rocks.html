                            I, as everybody, fear Doomsday stuff. Not the stuff that certainly
                            we won't have any control of for a long time, like sun getting
                            hotter or being in a range of a supernovae. But the well known
                            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120591/">asteriod impact</a>
                            scenario.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            History
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            May of us know that The Bible and many other revelations (like the
                            ones Nostradamus
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostradamus#Origins_of_The_Prophecies">
                                based his research on</a>) fortell the end of the world,
                            some via a fiery sky, some via the gread flood, some via both.
                            This scenario falls in line with what our planet experienced at the
                            end of the Mesozoic era, some 66 million years ago. A an asteriod
                            of many kilometers in diameter
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event">
                                impacted Earth
                            </a>, almost punching through to
                            the mantle. Huge shock waves and enormous tsunamies followed. Earth
                            rained back down from the sky in lethal fireballs around the globe.
                            Vast clouds of sulfur-bearing gases blocked the sun and then fell down
                            as lethal acid rain. Perhaps a century of persisent winter followed.
                            Only a few tropical islands allowed life to survive, life that could
                            take shelter in the water or underground. And even on those islands,
                            everything weighting over a couple of dozen kilograms disappeared.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sientists tell us that it's only a matter of time before another
                            impact of a huge magnitude happens. What scares me most is that we
                            have no idea when it could happen. But I must stress "could", not
                            "will".

                        <h2>
                            Imagination
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            I remember driving on C-470 towards the mountains (not too far form the
                            I-25 exit), at the end of the day and looking at the front range. Suddenly
                            I imagined waves coming towards Denver, spilling over the rockies. And
                            knowing of the huge tsunamies that came 66 million years ago I did not
                            dismiss this vision outright. Later I found out that those tsunamies
                            are estimated to have been around 300 meters in height. But the impact
                            was made over land. I can certainly imagine a scenario where a
                            large asteroid impacts the Pacific Ocean at
                            an angle that would cause the shockwave to displace enough water which would
                            spill over the Rockies or at least around them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I was awestruck by this vision and still remeber it well. But overtime
                            I have amassed enough knowledge to belive that there is something we
                            can do about this. And it looks like the dawn of this age (where this
                            ability will become a reality) is upon us.

                            What is really needed.
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            There is one thing that is trully needed to reroute a large asteriod
                            from a collision course with Earth - time. We need enough time to
                            send equipment into space and make it all work. We've been able
                            to imagine how we could do it even with
                            20th century technology, maybe as simply as
                            <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/02/painting-asteroids/">
                                painting it</a>. But how do we detect an asteriod on a collision course
                            far enough in advance to change its trajectory?
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            The How
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            The answer is simple - we need to build detection networks that can
                            keep track of all asteriods around us. First we can build them
                            around our planet to see what is nearby and eventually we can build them
                            in the nearby space of the solar system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These detection networks can consist of satelites fitted with wide-range
                            telescopes (optical or whatever other kind works) capable of detecting
                            relatively small objects over very long distances. Long enough for us
                            to deploy trajectory changing equipment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm certain that by the time we deploy this network of satelites we will
                            come up with even more accurate detection equipment than we have now.
                            Afterall, pretty much everybody else on the planet is as motivated by
                            this cause as am I. Perhaps detection equipment will be a network of
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational-wave_observatory">
                                gravity wave detecting
                            </a> lazers, going over vast distances to achieve much more sensitiviy
                            than we have now. With mesh of these covering the whole globe, we will
                            be able to triangulate the asteriod coordinates long before it comes
                            close.

                            It is my firm belief that the survival of the human race will depend on
                            how well we will protect our home planet and not on our ability to spread
                            beyond the planet. After all, "no holy place is never empty". As Bob
                            Marley said "if you know what life is worth you would look for yours
                            on earth". And I believe that with enough tolerance and work the course
                            of history can be changed to avoid the most grim of revelations.

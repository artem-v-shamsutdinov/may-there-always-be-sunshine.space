                            In order to park asteroids we need to be able to detect them first.
                            Most of the time we'll be detecting them and plotting their orbits
                            well in advance, perhaps several orbits in advance. But, in the
                            worst case scenario we might be detecting an asteroid on its
                            final approach before an impact with Earth.

                        <h2>
                            How much time/space?
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            In that case the question arises: how much time do we need before
                            an asteroid impacts in order to alter its trajectory? And
                            the answer is simple - as much time as we can get. So, what is the
                            farthest away point where we can detect an asteroid that can cause
                            planet-wide damage? What about
                            looking as far as the sun and the asteroid belt. That's about
                            one Astronomical Unit. Given sun-orbital velocities that gives
                            us about a month to month and a half lead time. Can we set up a
                            detection network that will cover all of relevant space (with orbits
                            that can potentially impact
                            Earth) and see all asteroids

                        <p>
                            Current detection mechanisms are limited to earth based wide-field
                            telescopes. This limits us to only night time observations and
                            these telescopes are not likely to be state of the art technology.
                            They definitely can't peer out that far and they miss a lot of
                            asteroids that we either find out about after they fly by or
                            don't find out about them at all.

                            Other methods

                        <p>
                            Are there any other methods besides telescopes we can use to detect
                            objects? As far as we can tell, no. Basically all radiation coming
                            towards us is in some form of light, just in different frequencies.
                            We do have a gravity detecting device and gravity does bend light.
                            But scaling that type of device up to detect differences in
                            gravitational fields as far as 1 AU is not likely to be possible (
                            even if we do manage to come up with good enough lasers that stay
                            focused enough over thousands of kilometers, or perhaps even
                            farther).

                            So, we'll need better telescopes. And we are constantly improving
                            on that front. The James Webb Space Telescope has

                                wide field</a> telescopes and we'll need lots of them
                            to cover all space around the planet that we can.

                        <h2>
                            Where to place them.
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Currently the vast majority of our telescopes are earth based.
                            This limits the frequencies they can observe at and also makes them
                            subject to the weather conditions at their respective locations.
                            What we need are telescopes in space. Definitely at least in earth
                            orbit, where we can maintain them. And eventually, perhaps on the
                            surface of the Moon, once we establish a permanent presence there.
                            Ther we could more easily place and maintain large telescopes that
                            could potentially be manufactured right on the Moon.

As a logic driven person I believe into the education I have
recieved that is rooted in the scientific method.  As a believer
in God I'm deeply rooted in the moral beginnings of of Humanity.
And I don't find the two unreconsilable.


But, before I can talk about the history of Humanity I must
talk about my understanding of the history of Earth, to which
we are naturally tied (and I would stress that, hopefully no
matter what kind of pressure I might experience to acknowledge
the truth of our heaven based existence).

I rember one night I was thinking about the Mother Earth and how
it could be a half-consious giant, half machine.  I was also
thinking of highly advanced triangulation techniques that allowed
for magic-like operations to be performed in and around us.

Many people have been having thoughts like this for a long time.
Perhaps the most physical (but unacceptably violent) rendition of this
is the movie matrix.  People living out their lives in life support
tanks, while experiencing a virtual reality of the late 20th century.

Personally I believe Matrix was deeply misguided in its idea what
such an experience might be in real world and find that the example
set forth in Star Wars (and repeated in Bobba Fet) is much closer
to the true state of things.  The reason I can state this is because
I once had an experience like this.

After heavily (mostly emotionally and oratorically) exorting
myself for a period of time (and more importantly, somewhat
overreacting in a complaint about my exhaustion) I found myself
waking up not being able to move, feeling like I'm in a liquid
filled tank, with a breathing apparatus over my face.  Then I heard
my son cry out as he woke up in the middle of the night and I made
the decision that I had to get to him, no matter what is going on.
I made a decision to get out of the (apparently) immobalized position
I was in and after a few seconds of mussle strain I was able
to do so without any problems, with the liquid tank sensation
dissapearing right before I could move.

With God's good grace, the best explanation for this could I come up 
on that experience so far is that I was present both in my
bed and in a rejuvenation tank at the same exact time - go figure.  And
since then (perhaps being influenced by watching the Matrix)  I've been
thinking of a facility somewhere on Earth where such tanks might be
located (though I'm no longer sure of the grandiousness of the actual
setup that enables percieved pin-point rejuvenation capabilities that
I only experienced once and haven't experienced since then).  And, in
terms of physics the best I can come up with is a more advanced version
of Star Trek's "beam me up Scotty" except that I wasn't take appart
into a gazillion of particles but moved wholesale, as I was (and for
a period of time occupied a space in two locations at the same time).

I do not find the concepts of Heaven and Hell and a billion of years of
evolution unreconsilable.  It's easy for me to make that leap because
I base my belief in God on a very simple explanation that it is ilogical
to explain the existence of the unverse, and it being created in a single
exposive event by any other means than the existence of God who was
able to do so and who's existence is naturally beyond our capability
to explain since (as our latest theological theories state) God is by
definition present in all particles of the Universe and this in us as
well.

The same logic places the creation of Heaven and Hell (either by God himself
or by his angels subsequently) anytime before or after the creation of
the Unverse, thus giving a good 10 billion years to spare before our
Solar system even came into existence (in a very brief cosmic period, as
I'm try to reason about in a "gallactic" post).

I also don't mind the consept of Heaven and Hell being local to our planet
(or at least having a section that is localized right to our Earth), with
that section being created appropriately any time between 4.5 billion years
ago and a few million years ago (as man was finally created by God in heaven
and then send down to earth, may spiritually, to a species that was ready
to accept being man).

Ultimately, the truth is I have no idea what I'm talking about theologically
and just need to build a picture that reconsiles billions of years of gallactic
evolution and my Avraamic roots.  And having build a scematic that works for
me I'm able to work within it to define the history of humanity and thus
the strength and weaknesses we'll have when we'll finally come face to face
with "other little (but realtively much bigger) children".

This is not to say that I want us to behave and playground bullies once we
get big and strong enough but to protect our intellectual beginnings form
inadvertent (and perhaps extremely likely) bumps and bruses that in worse
case scenarios will result in loss of human lives (link to previous post).

Our best bet at morally surving an encouter with another superior (but not
overwhelmingly superior) race is our tie in with a billion year of our own
evolution, right here on Earth.

Vulerabilities - biblical isn't too bad (and can be abstracted away)
but the timeframes listed are a
huge vulerability.

Hinduism - research

Chinese - ?belive to be created by Gods? - probably a very big vulerability
in bad actor scenarios where civilizations (perhaps in an attempt to
toughen us up) could claim that we are their direct decendants.

I believe that evolutionary rooting (that doesn't deny a divine spark of the One God,
with most likely overwhelming provable actions by Angels, perhaps from multiple levels
of existence and at different times in Earth, Earth's living organism,
animal, mamal and human history) is our best best at long term survival and ensuring
capability to help ourselves and eventually others.

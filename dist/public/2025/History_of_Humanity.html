In this post I'm writing about my beliefs. I must first state
: I mean absolutely no disrespect for any religions of
the world. As a military family baby, raised as a "son of
the regiment" I tend to look at everything through the prism
of - can it hurt me and my family. The only prayer I have
revolves around a chant of:

"Спасибо Господи что мы живы, целы и невредимы, здоровы,
живем долго и счастливо"

Before the one true God, the creator of the Universe, I state
that I believe everything I'm writing in this post is true.

As a logic driven person I believe into the education I have
recieved that is rooted in the scientific method. As a believer
in God I'm deeply rooted in the moral beginnings of of Humanity.
And I don't find the two unreconsilable.

But, before I can talk about the history of Humanity I must
consider my understanding of the history of Earth, to which
we are naturally tied (and I would stress that, hopefully no
matter what kind of pressure I might experience to acknowledge
the truth of our heaven based existence).

I rember one night I was thinking about the Mother Earth and how
it could be a half-consious giant, half machine. I was also
thinking of highly advanced triangulation techniques that allowed
for magic-like operations to be performed in and around us.

Many people have been having thoughts like this for a long time.
Perhaps the most physical (but unacceptably violent) rendition of this
is the movie matrix. People living out their lives in life support
tanks, while experiencing a virtual reality of the late 20th century.

Personally I believe Matrix was deeply misguided in its idea what
such an experience might be in real world and find that the example
set forth in Star Wars (and repeated in Bobba Fet) is much closer
to the true state of things. The reason I can state this is because
I once had an experience like this.

After heavily (mostly emotionally and oratorically) exorting
myself for a period of time (and more importantly, somewhat
overreacting in a complaint about my exhaustion) I found myself
waking up not being able to move, feeling like I'm in a liquid
filled tank, with a breathing apparatus over my face. Then I heard
my son cry out as he woke up in the middle of the night and I made
the decision that I had to get to him, no matter what is going on.
I started to get out of the (apparently) immobalized position.
After a few seconds of mussle strain I was able
to do so without any problems, with the liquid tank sensation
dissapearing right before I could move.

With God's good grace, the best explanation for this could I come up
on that experience so far is that I was present both in my
bed and in a rejuvenation tank at the same exact time - go figure. And
since then (perhaps being influenced by watching the Matrix) I've been
thinking of a facility somewhere on Earth where such tanks might be
located (though I'm no longer sure of the grandiousness of the actual
setup that enables percieved pin-point rejuvenation capabilities that
I only experienced once and haven't experienced since then). And, in
terms of physics the best I can come up with is a more advanced version
of Star Trek's "beam me up Scotty" except that I wasn't take appart
into a gazillion of particles but moved wholesale, as I was (and for
a period of time occupied a space in two locations at the same time).



I remember stumbling across a YouTube video that very convinsingly presented
facts and puctures of the two following facts:

Volcano on camchatka - nasip'
Huge circular excavator claw marks in Antarctica

Basically stating that there have been huge construction projects on Earth
well after it's creation. This seems very plausible and logical to me -
no matter how perfect the original creation is, there is always room for
improvement. Especially if the new super-structure adds a level of realism
to the human experience (which I greatly appreciate).



How earth was formed (4.5 B?? less on the planet itself) but galaxy around
for 14B and has all of the elements necessary for creation of life for ???).

Earth has a pefect size moon (formed probably after a collision with
another planetoid).

Early periods of live - build up of oxygen.

Planet wide glaciations.

Cambrian explosions

The asteroid event

Rise of the Mamals

Common ansestors of Humans and Greater Chimps


I do not find the concepts of Heaven and Hell and a billion of years of
evolution unreconsilable. It's easy for me to make that leap because
I base my belief in God on a very simple explanation that it is ilogical
to explain the existence of the unverse, and it being created in a single
exposive event by any other means than the existence of God who was
able to do so and who's existence is naturally beyond our capability
to explain since (as our latest theological theories state) God is by
definition present in all particles of the Universe and this in us as
well.

The same logic places the creation of Heaven and Hell (either by God himself
or by his angels subsequently) anytime before or after the creation of
the Unverse, thus giving a good 10 billion years to spare before our
Solar system even came into existence (in a very brief cosmic period, as
I'm try to reason about in a "gallactic" post).

I also don't mind the consept of Heaven and Hell being local to our planet
(or at least having a section that is localized right to our Earth), with
that section being created appropriately any time between 4.5 billion years
ago and a few million years ago (as man was finally created by God in heaven
and then send down to earth, may spiritually, to a species that was ready
to accept being man).

Ultimately, the truth is I have no idea what I'm talking about theologically
and just need to build a picture that reconsiles billions of years of gallactic
evolution and my Avraamic roots. And having build a scematic that works for
me I'm able to work within it to define the history of humanity and thus
the strength and weaknesses we'll have when we'll finally come face to face
with "other little (but realtively much bigger) children".

This is not to say that I want us to behave and playground bullies once we
get big and strong enough but to protect our intellectual beginnings form
inadvertent (and perhaps extremely likely) bumps and bruses that in worse
case scenarios will result in loss of human lives (link to previous post).

...

Our best bet at morally surving an encouter with another superior (but not
overwhelmingly superior) race is our tie in with a billion year of our own
evolution, right here on Earth.

Religion analysis - ability to support morale

First of all, I really think that from a morale point of view all religions,
from the very primitive to the very advanced play a role and complement each
other. In fact it appears that God has setup for us a perfect cocktail of
survivability boosters. Of course I would again like to state - I'm a
complete layman and at this point am interested in only one aspect -
how religions help us survive and thrive in a first contact scenario and
beyond.

1) Nature based religions.

Nature based religions root us deeply in our planet. They probably got many
of Earth based systems right and in either case root us back to the creation
of the planet. They lay a pefectly valid claim to our land (at least literally
the dry land), with this mind set you have the full right to continue to exist
on this planet. Unfortunately the got basically everything farther away from
Earth wrong, from a sientific point of view. This means that they are useless
for claims for interstellar travel or even claims to our Solar System. Also,
if we only have the nature based religions it will be hard to maintain the
population density required to get to interstellar travel. I consider these
religions as a root that keeps us grounded and keeps our heads thinking about
what they should really be thinking - our one planet Earth that will always be
our home (given that every other place that supports life belongs or will belong
to its natives).

2) Daoism

Chinese - ?belive to be created by Gods? - probably a very big vulerability
in bad actor scenarios where civilizations (perhaps in an attempt to
toughen us up) could claim that we are their direct decendants.

Good -
Rooted in neolithic beliefs, thus being a hybrid of naturalistic religions
(givings land ownership rights and roots) and a more advanced theory that
explains the universe in a way that still works.

Ying and Yang - the two begingings of the universe, light and
darkness, male and female. It does work well with our present scientific knowledge
but it doesn't directly explain the creation (big bang event).

3) Hinduism

I strongly suspect that Hinduism (with it's enormous ability to absorbe beliefs)
has been externally affected - that I consider to be a major draw-back. But,
again, in quick integration scenarios, it would probably be Hinduism that will
let us survive and thrive.

Hinduism includes in itself some ancient knowledge (that only God knows how we got)
which talks of multiple dosens of Universes being created before ours and several
more to be created after. This may be a very important factor if we are faced with
immediate galactic integration at highest levels, which I pray we won't have to
go through. But in the more likely scenario, this will probabluy remain a hidden
knowledge outside of the mainstream.

The draw back of Hinduism is existence of Sun worshiping. If all Suns trully are
"sons" of God (with black holes being "daughters"), then we are stuck worshiping
(only possibly) a single semi-scenient being of which there is an enormous multitude
in the universe. What's worse is that if our Solar system was created by beings
(at the very least at that time) present in our time space, then we are stuck
worshiping a creation of (in best case scenario) ancient angels and not the
direct creation of God (which may be, given how unbelievebly quickly our solar system
was created, more on that in the galactic post).

4) Judaism

Monotheism - a huge win!

Vulerabilities - biblical isn't too bad (and can be abstracted away)
but the timeframes listed are a
huge vulerability - we should be thinking in billions of years, for initial
survivability.

5) Cristianity

Trinity - they got the numbers right, but brought it down to the holy sprit and
the son of god. It's a tie in to the world around us. It is also a great
anti-slavery tool.

The drawback is that it keeps us at the level of children of God, which we likely
are not (at least not direct children). Probably a more accurate statement
(derived in Soviet Union) is that we are children of the Galaxy and don't matter
so much in other Galaxies.

6) Islam

The pinnacle - it is pretty clear to me that there is a perfectly logical reason
why Islam states that Mohammed was the last profit - we just don't need anymore,
he got it covered.

Most importantly it states that God created the whole Universe. I don't think much
explanation is needed here. Any actors within the Universe wouldn't measure up
and are likely of the same but earlier nature or possibly Angels (in which case they
wouldn't be a threat anyway).

The other big thing is the statement that God is everywhere in the Universe (God
is grand) - that explainst no matter how many super-systems have been built up on
Galactic level (or levels closer to us), ultimately it is the God's presense trumps
it all.

And, very symbolically one religion that symbolically claimed the Moon as our own. This is a huge
win, realized by the landing of Austornauts on the moon.

Lasly Islam is signed by God since Koran is rymed. If we had nothing else the one
religion I would want the world to have (to survive and thrive) is Islam.

That being said there is a lot of value in diversity and synergy between different
religions. This diversity gives us great flexibility for a very large variety of
scenarios, with some regions of the world better adapting to varios interactions
with extraterrestrials.






I believe that evolutionary rooting (that doesn't deny a divine spark of the One God,
with most likely overwhelming provable actions by Angels, perhaps from multiple levels
of existence and at different times in Earth, Earth's living organism,
animal, mamal and human history) is our best best at long term survival and ensuring
capability to help ourselves and eventually others.

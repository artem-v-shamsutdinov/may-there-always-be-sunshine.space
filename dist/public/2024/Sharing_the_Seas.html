Assumption - we accomplish the initial gola (~60 years) 
- secure status of self-managed resource colony, while
"skirting under the prime directive" by securing access
to the orbit and beyond via a tighly regulated ("need to know"
basis) security organization - the Orbfleet.

Where do we go next?  Well how does Earth look from space -
it's mostly blue due to majority of the surface area
being covered in oceans.  That's lots of space that can
be shared with someone (we don't want to grow gills that
would look ugly on us, right?).  If we don't share on our
own accord, someone will probably make sure we share anyway.
And with so many ocean containing planets in our solar
system (and with the assumption that life is universal and
thus develops into intelligent life whereever possible) the
perfect plan is to share it ourselves with species right
in our solar system.  Mythologically this could be described as:
if Mother Earth has intelligence this is what she probably would
want if she was presented with the above specified alternatives.

Moral grounds - all intelligent species in our Solar System
deserve the right to live in conditions with access to Solar light
and the eventual right to evolve to space faring civilizations.
This can be done organically with the inhabitants of the dry
land (us), over prolonged periods of time.

Security grounds - establish patronage with (Solar System-)local
intelligent species what by default will owe us securing
Earth's Oceans ("fins the water"/"claws on the ground" control)
from external threats. We in-turn owe them guarantees of
technological development at the pace of their
choosing and provide secure space for their future cultural
(and eventually evolutionary) advancement.

Initial goal - test out sharing with species that won't complete
with us (for sure):

Project 'Europa' (~600 years) - start securing water surface - begin sharing the Indian ocean
with the hypothesized "lesser aquatics" in our solar system (on
the premise of if we don't manage the process someone else will)

Eventual goal - allow all intelligent species in the solar system
to live with access to Solar light

Project 'Pluto' (~6000 years) - finish securing the planet as a
whole - Pacific also shared with the hypothesized "greater aquatics"
in our solar system (project 'Pluto')

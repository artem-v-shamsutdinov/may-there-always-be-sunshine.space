Baby boom

We are children of the Galaxy, Earth is the cradle of Humanity.  In that sense the
generalization of our Galaxy being the polis of which we are a citizen seems
rather appropriate.

But of course a polis (especially as large the Milky Way galaxy) isn't a simple
pre-planned, mono-industrial city.  Probably a better equivalent would be a large
Metropolitan Statistical Area like Denver which consists of 50 cities/towns in
6 counties.  Each county has a separate governance structure and each municipal
government governs its own affairs.  Some towns join together to form larger
districts, while others hold districts of their own - it's a very complex
polit-economical picture inside a Metro Area.  But it's a distict popopulated
area that can be clearly seen from space when it's not shone upon
by the Sun.

The city

Sientist estimate that about 10 billion years ago our Galaxy went through a
cataclysmic event when it collided with Gaia-Enceladus (though not as
catastrophically as our neighboring Andromeda since it retained a modified
disk structure).  Such an event must have made a deep cultural impact on
civilizations that lived through it (and may still be existing even now).
And even back then the gravitational forces in our inter-galactic neighborhood
would have clearly shown the future the Milky Way and Andromeda (and perhaps other
nearbly galaxy(ies) together).  One would think that civilizations that last
billions of years will be thinking about future cataclysms and planning ahead
(more on that in a bit).

The best is for children

We don't know what plans they would have (but in our childish imaginations we
can dream of 3 galaxies balancing each other out in a spinning dance or bubbles
around galaxies that expand space and push them away from each other), but we do
know that about 4.5 billion years ago, our own solar system was formed in an
unbelievably short period of 200,000 years.  And I'm venturing a guess (based
on the other near by solar systems where we found potentially habitable planets)
that our Solar System is rather unique in that it has 8-9 planets.  I'll
leave the rest to the imagination of the reader but we do also know that Mars
could have been that planet that would have supported surface life (some 3.7
billion years ago) but it ended up being Earth that bore the first intelligent
species in our Solar System (that we know of, at least).  And I won't even
be remotely brave enough to talk about the history of asteroid impacts on
our own Earth.  Rather, I would prefer to think of our Solar System as a kind
of a playground where someone decided to plaint the marry go round in red, some
billion years ago.  I just hope that the playground is setup in a well secured
back yard of a local pre-school (with a nice and tall picket fence around it, that
might only have a few holes for students to get through) and not a town-wide
showcase where hulligans hang out after dark.

With such images it's easy to imagine ourself and other intelligent specicies
that arguably occupy other ice laden planets/moons in our system as students
of a nursery (the inner solar system, inside the Oort cloud).

The inter-polis conflicts

But before I get into our own business, as a good child that I am, I would like
to explore what's around, what's out there.  And what's immediately out there
is our neighboring polis, the more rough and battle hardened Andromeda.  It has
a shape that speaks of previous colisions that were more violent than what
the Milky Way went through.

Our sientist predict that (unless something can/will be done about it) the
Mikly Way will collide with the Andromeda in some 500 million years.  This collision
isn't predicted to wipe out most of the worlds but statistically speaking (
again I would like to stress, if it were to happen, since I do believe that
the bigger the collective the more can be done) but (based on pure statistics)
at least some of the worlds would be wiped off the face of the bigger galaxy that
would form.

We probably don't know (at least not exactly) what large effects would mergers of
mega of black holes in centers of galaxies would cause but we do know that there
are places in the univers where enormous explosions have wiped out huge areas
of space (with perhaps dozens if not hunderds of galaxies being destroyed).  We
also know (based on general gravitational effects) that there is a local center
of gravity around which we, the Andromeda and many other glalaxies rotate.  But,
there is nothing more we can learn about it (on our own, having seen it through
our own equipment and having formed our own opinion, thus contributing to the
overall galactic opinion on it) until we can build machies that can clear the
galactic disk and take clear measurements.


Being "a class favorite" and not "a class outcast"

Teachers tend to promote students that show potential.  And I can't think of a
better way to show such potential then to (link to sharing the seas post) help
other students in the class.

Going to elementary

Here in the States, once you've gotten out of preshool you go to elementary.
Except that when you change schools nobody knows you and in the case of
our immediate galactic neighborhood, everyone already knows you and you've
just been accepted to a bigger (more grown up) class.  And of course, I
would argue that the best way to get through elementary is to try to help
students to do their best and to help teachers give nurture and discipline
to the entire class.

Joining (and perhaps i"nadvertently" helping organize) the workforce.

So, with all this terminilogy and aphorisms in place, my argument is that we
and our playground of a Solar System (and perhaps dosens of not hunderds
of other such systems around our galaxy) are meant to unite the galaxy (
likely one region at a time, with maybe neighboring regions coming together
as a result of grad-school work of the students) and mobilize it to solve
bigger problems, that might seem abstract when you reside in the cradle
but might be real (on the clock) problems for the people that probably built
the playgrounds to begin with (and even for the people that have grown up
since then).


But, before we can get into any day dreaming of future quests for Humanity
where adventerous captains (being the best of the best and guided by God's
shining wisdom) help the galactic powers unite it and literally propel it
in the right direction (perhaps by guiding the incoming Small and Large
Magellanic Clouds and controlling the mass of, or safely exploding super
giant stars, or by far less primitive ways that we are yet to detect), we
must take care of business at home.  More on that in the next post ...

What if a baby planned ahead?

General premise - we need a long term plan, a very long term plan,
so long that we can see ourselves well beyond the current horizon of
possibilities of humanity.  Here is my version of it:

70 years - secure status of self-managed resource colony, while
"skirting under the prime directive" by securing access
to the orbit and beyond via a tighly regulated ("need to know"
basis) security organization - the Orbfleet.

This first step is an equivalent of a look of a realization on a
baby's face as he's about to climb out of the crib.  In stead of
following a pretty toy of getting a subtle push (on the butt) the 
baby appears to make a concious and serious (for his level)
decision to take on the walls of the crib.

700 years - start securing water surface - begin sharing the Indian ocean
with the hypothesized "lesser aquatics" in our solar system (on
the premise of if we don't manage the process someone else will)
(project 'Europa')

The second step is an equvalent of a look around the surronding room
and locating all of the nearby objects and showing some basic thought
process, instead of "just going for it".  And as he climbs out, he
gently takes his
mom's favorite interaction medium that's hung on the side of the crib
and consiously places it in the corder of the crib.

Now compare the two scenarious - if you were a dad that works all the
time and barely sees the baby what would impress you more:  the
expected scenario of carrot and stick and going for it more or less
blindly, or the pause to situate and figure out the best approach
and subsequently taken best course of action?  If you see the
consious approach, wouldn't you be
immediately impressed by your baby and start building better, long 
term plans for him and probably place him in the best daycare you
can afford?  Or, in the expected scenario not giving the moment much
attention and probably not remembering it in the long term (being a
dad), reasoning that there is nothing out of the ordinary here: Lets proceed with our
lives and take care of things as they come.  And what if other relatives,
especially grandparents were present during the event, would that
make for even bigger impact and better long term outcomes (provided
that the baby keeps on delivering)?  Wouldn't grand parents then
go the extra mile and share more of their wisdom and experience
and provide more care for the baby, if they see that this one has
the potential to help a lot of people?  And as he grows up even if
the baby strays away from the big plans the grand parents had for
him, the deviation from the plan would likely be considered a positive
showing of an evaluation and decision process of what's really best
(given baby's own relatiies) instead of blind stubborness and
disrespectful behavior.  Wouldn't it?  At least I'd like to think
it would.

What if a toddler looked after smaller siblings in his room?

7000 years - finish securing the planet as a whole - Pacific
also shared with the hypothesized "greater aquatics" in our solar
system (project 'Pluto')

What if a child managed the chores in the house?

70000 years - start securing our solar system - basic management
of the outer planets and asteriod/resource security

What if a 16 year remodeled the house?

700000 years - finish securing our solar system - initial star
management machinery

What if he took over the mortage and paid it off by 25?

7000000 years - extending the lifecycle of our Sun by reducing
its mass (and using the extracted energy for projects around
the system)


The important thing is not to hurry in the long term.  While
it is critical to make the first couple of milestones on time,
as time goes on further milestones can be extended out if needed.
After all, wouldn't you want your people to look the most handsome
the could possibly look as you change your sun from a short buring
5K+ to a slow but steady red candle?  Wouldn't you want to
very carefully work out all of the tidal locking kinds and a much
tighter orbit around the Sun as well as God knows what number of
other factors that will most definitely come up in the process?

70M - no longer up to us

Once we have accomplished the one goal we really have to do, in
best possible way (given resources and time constraints) we will
have shown that we can help others in even better ways and will
gain more trust as we are allowed to work on projects outside
of our house.  That is the next order of magnitute plan that
we best not make (or at least dictate others what it will be)
as that will be a collective decision, made largely by much older 
and much more wise and respected members of the nearby community.
But, that being said, wouldn't they want this guy to be running the
town (under their watchful eye) and bust his little butt
organizing people to fix it all up as well?

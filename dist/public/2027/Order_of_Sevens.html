General premise - we need a long term plan, a very long term plan,
so long that we can see ourselves well beyond the current horizon of
possibilities of humanity.  Here is my version of it:

70 years - secure status of self-managed resource colony, while
"skirting under the prime directive" by securing access
to the orbit and beyond via a tighly regulated ("need to know"
basis) security organization - the Orbfleet.

This first step is an equivalent of a look of a realization on a
baby's face as he's about to climb out of the crib.  In stead of
following a pretty toy of getting a subtle push (on the butt) the 
baby appears to make a concious and serious (for his level)
decision to take on the walls of the crib.

700 years - start securing water surface - begin sharing the Indian ocean
with the hypothesized "lesser aquatics" in our solar system (on
the premise of if we don't manage the process someone else will)
(project 'Europa')

The second step is an equvalent of a look around the surronding room
and locating all of the nearby objects and showing some basic thought
process, instead of "just going for it".  And as he climbs out, he
gently takes his
mom's favorite interaction medium that's hung on the side of the crib
and consiously places it in the corder of the crib.

Now compare the two scenarious - if you were a dad that works all the
time and barely sees the baby what would impress you more:  the
expected scenario of carrot and stick and going for it more or less
blindly, or the pause to situate and figure out the best approach
and subsequently taken best course of action?  If you see the
consious approach, wouldn't you be
immediately impressed by your baby and start building better, long 
term plans for him and probably place him in the best daycare you
can afford?  Or, in the expected scenario not giving the moment much
attention and probably not remembering it in the long term (being a
dad), reasoning that there is nothing out of the ordinary here: Lets proceed with our
lives and take care of things as they come.  And what if other relatives,
especially grandparents were present during the event, would that
make for even bigger impact and better long term outcomes (provided
that the baby keeps on delivering)?  Wouldn't grand parents then
go the extra mile and share more of their wisdom and experience
and provide more care for the baby, if they see that this one has
the potential to help a lot of people?

7000 years - finish securing the planet as a whole - Pacific
also shared with the hypothesized "greater aquatics" in our solar
system (project 'Pluto')

70000 years - start securing our solar system - basic management
of the outer planets and asteriod/resource security

700000 years - finish securing our solar system - initial star
management machinery

7000000 years - extending the lifecycle of our Sun by reducing
its mass (and using the extracted energy for projects around
the system)

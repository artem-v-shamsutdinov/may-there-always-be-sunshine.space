General premise - we need a long term plan, a very long term plan,
so long that we can see ourselves well beyond the current horizon of
possibilities of humanity.  Here is my version of it:

60 years - secure status of self-managed resource colony, while
"skirting under the prime directive" by securing access
to the orbit and beyond via a tighly regulated ("need to know"
basis) security organization - the Orbfleet.
600 years - start securing water surface - begin sharing the Indian ocean
with the hypothesized "lesser aquatics" in our solar system (on
the premise of if we don't manage the process someone else will)
(project 'Europa')
6000 years - finish securing the planet as a whole - Pacific
also shared with the hypothesized "greater aquatics" in our solar
system (project 'Pluto')
60000 years - start securing our solar system - basic management
of the outer planets and asteriod/resource security
600000 years - finish securing our solar system - initial star
management machinery
6000000 years - extending the lifecycle of our Sun

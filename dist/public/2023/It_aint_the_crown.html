                            <u>Phase 1. 0 - 70</u> <b>"The tea spoon"</b> Get the ball out of the big pond - get the
                            diversants out of the ocean by explaining that it's our space, we'll populate guys from
                            Europa and Pluto there (and wherever else in our own solar system). "That's what mom wants
                            anyway". <b>Update 3/30</b>
                            And build the fucking <a href="https://www.isec.org/who-we-are">space elevator</a>, you
                            fucking fags - it looks like <a

                            it in and out (look at satelite imagery of Buckley Space Force base).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <u>Phase 2. 70 - 700</u> <b>"The under-tea-cup plate"</b> Secure our own ball (from the
                            bullies that
                            stopped by the playground). Prep the ocean for population - first experiment in Indian
                            ocean, with the lesser developed race (Europa?)
                        </p>

                            <u>Phase 3. 700-7K</u> <b>"The soup plate"</b> Get the ball to the new kid from the burned
                            out house. Get
                            Venus ready for initial population by the picked out friendlies. Yes, this will involve
                            external help with moving, burning off atmosphere, etc. But it's really only for the initial
                            group of settlers.

                            <u>Phase 4. 7K-70K</u> <b>"The big dish".</b> Clean up the playground. Asteroid safety,
                            initial venturing into the neighborhood.
                        </p>

                            <u>Phase 5. 70K-700K</u> <b>"The rubik's cube"</b> - safely go grocery shopping.
                            Get approval from "Startrek Borg" and ability to safely traverse the galaxy (city). Start
                            building lego toys - initial machines (not yet tetrahedrons) to manage the heating up Sun.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <u>Phase 6. 700K-7M</u> <b>"The 3D triangle rubik's cube"</b> (look it up, it actually
                            exists, my uncle had one) - get under the playground tree, it's getting hot. Get approval
                            from the everlasting (perhaps androidal) culture. Build tetrahedron machines that can (I
                            guess) both manage Sun's surface and move planets (on our own, finally). Use the extracted
                            energy to setup whatever infrastructure we need in the solar system at that point.
                        </p>

                            <u>Phase 7 7M - 70M</u> <b>"The ball pump needle"</b> - un-blow the soap bubble (the one
                            that is blown via a pipe). Build long ass, very thin, deep drills with shielding and yet
                            to be understood density management to extract metals from the Sun's core (didn't we drill
                            all the way down to hell here on Earth already?) :)

                            <u>Phase 8 70M - 700M</u> <b>"The pimple"</b> - deal with the polka dot shirt. By now we've
                            done one rotation around the city/galaxy that has many traveling black holes. Using even
                            longer and stronger pipes we can now suck material away from a black hole in the direction
                            needed to properly move it. If that's too much for the physicists here (c'mon you know we
                            are in the stone age right now, given how much time has passed for the "angels") then
                            suck the material around the black holes. Or just build a machine big enough to
                            gravitationally pull the black hole while not being within the event horison and have the
                            power to move away. In any case by that time we'll be able to deal with the problem of
                            the destructive black holes.

                            <u>Phase 9</u> (How knows how long but might not have time on this schedule, so maybe if we
                            really work hard we can save some time in the later stages) <b>The road paver</b> - get a
                            job and flatten the bump in the road. Now that we can move the black holes, join the road
                            maintenace crew and speed up the rotating galaxy in a direction that will "move the ship" to
                            excape the gravitational well of Andromeda (which might actually be smaller than us based on
                            the latest research) so that the bulk of the galaxy will move past it (parts will have to be
                            tranfered from both sides for continued star building). And flatten Andromeda in the process
                            - those "goat cheeses".

                            can't see out of the galaxy, at light speed we gotta wait 2 thousand years to get something
                            out that far (and the message back, heck for the guys that have multi-billion year old
                            civilizations, that's nothing and I strongly suspect some of them stuck around to make just
                            the right size rings in the dust cloud of our soon-to-be solar system - it took <a

                                years as we now know</a> to make it nice and mathematical - and you can do that with the
                            above mentioned tetrahedrons, like putting a finger in a spinning circle with paint) (plus
                            the acceleration and building time) to see the local gravitational center around which we
                            all are probably rotating. But probably we need to shake (or spin or whatever is needed) it
                            up so that we don't collapse in (or bump into stuff). So, boys, rev up the engine and blow
                            past the local STEM school to get those smart children to man up. And make sure to pay
                            attention - they are probably playing with a ball in the driveline next to the road you are
                            roaring on! And yes, I did just text the cop (about this occurence half an hourish ago) that
                            found our minivan yesterday with the license plate number of that white sedan and wrote:

                            guess) both manage Sun's surface and move planets (on our own, finally). Use the extracted

                            done one rotation around the city/galaxy that has many traveling black holes. Using even
                            longer and stronger pipes we can now suck material away from a black hole in the direction
                            needed to properly move it. If that's too much for the physicists here (c'mon you know we
                            are in the stone age right now, given how much time has passed for the "angels") then
                            suck the material around the black holes. Or just build a machine big enough to
                            gravitationally pull the black hole while not being within the event horison and have the
                            power to move away. In any case by that time we'll be able to deal with the problem of
                            the destructive black holes.

                            the latest research) so that the bulk of the galaxy will move past it (parts will have to be
                            tranfered from both sides for continued star building). And flatten Andromeda in the process

                            the acceleration and building time) to see the local gravitational center around which we
                            all are probably rotating. But probably we need to shake (or spin or whatever is needed) it
                            up so that we don't collapse in (or bump into stuff). So, boys, rev up the engine and blow
                            past the local STEM school to get those smart children to man up. And make sure to pay
                            attention - they are probably playing with a ball in the driveline next to the road you are
                            roaring on! And yes, I did just text the cop (about this occurence half an hourish ago) that

                                greater circle of friends. And it ain't that bad - we are learning to smile and to grip.
                                And yes parental leave should last at least one season!

                                will determine what kind of people we'll be for eons to come.

                                Of course it's all about the family, yet there'll be learning and work for us too,
                                simple at first and increasingly more serious. And, given how long the cosmos has been
                                and will be around, it seems befitting to measure the age of trully Cosmic civilizations
                                in millions of years (of Motherland's rotation), don't you think?

                                eventually (certainly I'm in no hurry) become a truly cosmic civilization that will
                                stand on its own and become first a parent and then a grand-parent race. And (logic
                                dictates that :) this is exactly what our "parents" and "grandparents" are hoping for.

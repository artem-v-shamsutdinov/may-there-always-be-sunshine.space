                            The initial
                            <a href="./Aint_no_sunshine.html">reflections</a> on a
                            <a href="./Coming_in_on_a_Wing_and_a_Prayer.html">possible scenario</a>
                            are leading me to the following train of thought:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The scenario of setting up a resource colony seems like the most likely one.  This is
                            probably the only way to ensure long term flow of resources.  We ourselves have gone through
                            a number of variants of extracting resources from colonies.  All were and (and still,
                            virtually are) bloody and placed us in an inferior (low ground) position.  By far the most
                            successful one took place in North America, with (God driven) migration of highly moral and
                            highly motivated small groups of colonists (with families).  A distant second is
                            the Australian variant, with forced labor of convicts.  These are most likely the two
                            scenarios we are likely facing, in the overall splinter group scenario.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A decision center in a highly moral advanced civilization will most likely limit the success
                            of the colonization based on outcomes in their (likely much longer) recorded history. My
                            hunch is that the forced
                            labor scenario is more likely but it is imossible to rule out a more impulsive scenario of
                            a desperate group of colonists - mostly peaceful and well meaning civilians. Even with the
                            convict scenario the quality of (non shock force) labor will be well above
                            our general population due to (very highley likely) advanced correction technology and
                            techniques - they (most likely) lagely wouldn't be hostile (again barring the shock force).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With the family groups scenario the likely outcome is the spread first across the continent
                            and then possibly North (though that appears to be a defensible position).  A total New
                            World
                            scenario is possible as well but is less likely due to lower moral grounds.  Though
                            disabling capability can be justified if a (relatively) peaceful group of colonists is wiped
                            out in an initial retaliatory attack (may God forbid such a scenario - it doesn't take a
                            general to understand that in such a course of
                            events we have to show discipline and react symmetrically, prioritizing civilian life).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The scenario of a penal colony appears to be more manageble in the long term, with possible
                            decolonization once the flow of resources is automated, agreed upon by locals, and properly
                            supervised.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next question then arises - what is the best way to avoid such scenarios.  Given that
                            the most logical reason for colonization is extraction of resources, perhaps a deal can be
                            struck to supply the needed resources a la UAE scenario at first. Subsequently likely best
                            outcome would be properly paced industrialization, a la late 20th century China, barring
                            exessive centralization. My take is that the most important thing is to develop our own
                            technological and industrial base, without being put on an external growth catalyst.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Taking this course of action could potentially be justified by the outcome of the blackout
                            scenario, stating that we
                            need to build space infrastructure (to explain the event and prepare for the future). 
                            Primarily a space
                            elevator (at the easiest possible point - Galapagos), which will allow steady flow of
                            resources first to orbit and then beyond.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As history has shown, large construction projects usually pay off.  I would add that this
                            should be done in a need-to-know way to prevent growth stunting (to allow development of
                            our own technological base and winner mentality).  This means that likely the only way to
                            accomplish this is a (slow but steady) merger of global industrial capacities and
                            organization of a self-defence force, a la orbital version of starfleet.  Any ventures
                            beyond Earth Orbit must be controlled until the next big move.

                            This this article I would like to finish writing on (and thinking deeply about) this topic -
                            may the Lord help us if such a scenario takes place.

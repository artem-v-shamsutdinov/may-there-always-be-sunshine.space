                            I'm pretty sure only 2 people in the world have ever looked at this blog with one being
                            family and the other a close childhood friend. And I will share this post with only two
                            addressees. Nonetheless, dear reader, if your favorite network search algorithm has taken
                            you to this page because you happen to be looking for this information, I hope that the
                            information that I present here gives you another perspective and helps you stay well:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As probably half the population of Earth I also wonder about extraterrestrial life. Of
                            course I don't know for sure if there is life outside of our world but given the size of the
                            Universe (or even just the size of our galaxy) and the fact that we already found plenty of
                            planets with even better conditions for life than Earth (right in our galactic neighborhood)
                            I assume that life is truly universal and is present wherever it can possibly exist. With
                            that assumption and knowing the laws of evolution it is easy to make another assumption that
                            intelligent life is also universal and (at any given time) is present in a good fraction of
                            all planets that can support life in general.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm also coming from a position that, just as evolution, technological progress cannot be
                            stopped. This means that eventually all technological civilizations become space-faring and,
                            as they gain more and more knowledge on how gravity, electro-magnetism and fusion (among
                            other things) work, their ability to travel across space ever increases.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So if intelligent life is truly universal, why haven't we been visited by extraterrestrials
                            in a way that would make a deep imprint in our recorded history (at least in the last 2.5
                            thousand years)? Why haven't we been in the worst case wiped out and in the best case
                            integrated into a more technologically advanced civilization? There must be a reason why we
                            have been allowed to develop a technological civilization of our own (that is now on the
                            verge of harnessing fusion power for its needs). I've been wondering about this for a while
                            and still haven't been able to find the clear and simple answer. My faith in God (and
                            reduction in warfare after the advent of nuclear weapons) tells me that as civilizations
                            become more advanced they (on average) become more morally sound and preclude themselves
                            from interfering with development of primitive civilizations. But I'm also a hyper-realist
                            and am seeking real-world arguments to support this - there must also be real, practical
                            reasons for why we've gotten as far as we have, all on our own. And the breadth of the
                            scenarios that are possible is so vast that it's impossible to cover them all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course, I'm not interested in scenarios where everything is hunky-dory. If there is a
                            galactic order with well enforced policing rules we probably have little to worry about. A
                            more scary but manageable scenario is that there are several interacting power centers in
                            our vicinity (relatively speaking) and that we are (for the time being at least) under
                            protectorate of one of them (perhaps located in their territory). The scariest and perhaps
                            most realistic scenario (at least from the point of view of a 0.7 civilization that
                            considers space travel hard and very time consuming) is that we just haven't been important
                            enough and close enough for anybody to truly take interest in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But, there is yet another factor that places our solar system into a higher demand bracket -
                            Venus. Statistically speaking there is bound to be a civilization out there in need of a new
                            planet (perhaps due to an inevitable cosmic catastrophe). A civilization that perhaps knew
                            about this (due to predictable movement of stars and projections of their life cycles) well
                            in advance, perhaps for millions of years. That would give this civilization enough time to
                            find a suitable enough (at least eventually) replacement planet and build machines big and
                            powerful enough to get the job done.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While it may be easier to move to a planet that already supports life it may not be feasible
                            due to viral and bacterial differences as well as the composition of atmosphere. And there
                            may be (perhaps naturally enforced) rules against taking over planets that already have life
                            on it (and are presumed to eventually develop intelligent life). Venus has no life on it
                            (<b>Update 5/16</b> at least not on it's surface) and is a bit too close to the Sun to
                            support it. That may seem to be an impossible problem to solve but imagine a civilization
                            that is a million years ahead of us in technological development and in accumulated
                            hardware. Over long periods of time and using raw materials from entire solar systems it
                            could build machines bigger than our planet. Machines that (if properly positioned) could
                            cause enough gravitational pull to change orbits of planets like Earth and Venus. Such
                            machines could be powered by fusion and fueled by (already pretty warm) hydrogen, acquired
                            by simply taking the machines into the outer layer of a star and pushing fuel into
                            reservoirs. This could be done with the help of magnetic field shielding (which we already
                            know how to accomplish) on a massive scale.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even though I've been thinking about this for a while I didn't find enough reason to record
                            my thoughts until I heard about Baba Vanga's predictions for 2023. According to this
                            time-space sensitive foreteller (who had a track record of 80% accuracy), in 2023 the Earth
                            orbit will change. Reading about this last December caused me to really start considering
                            scenarios of how this could happen. And it turns out that based on gravitational effects of
                            the position of our planets there is one particular moment in time when this could happen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Right around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPXM9TdyJRU&t=66s">August 16th</a>
                            of this year, the Sun, Venus and Earth will align, with the new
                            Blue (meaning close to Earth) Moon being in between Venus and Earth. And over the course of
                            the following 2 months the position of (first) Saturn and (then) Jupiter will be pulling
                            both Venus and Earth away from the Sun.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My guess is that if you apply enough gravitational force to Venus the shift in the
                            gravitational center of the solar system (provided by the planet's positions and as well as
                            their subsequent movement) would cause a multiplication effect that would move it much
                            further out than it would under other conditions. And, given enough time, perhaps thousands
                            of years, repeating this process would eventually pull Venus into the habitable zone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But with Earth likely being close to the inner edge of the habitable zone such repositioning
                            of Venus would not be gravitationally stable (and thus would not be safe for inhabitants of
                            both planets). Earth would have to move out as well. And moving a planet with liquid water
                            on top of it would likely cause a mass extinction event due to huge tidal effects on the
                            surface. This would be combined with extremely high precipitation caused by warming of the
                            oceans (due to increased friction) and mass absorption of water into the atmosphere. Even
                            worse, eventually the applied gravitational pull (compound by the reduced weight of
                            the water that would be moved to dry surface) could cause increased tectonic activity,
                            shallowing of the oceans and (potentially permanent) covering of large parts of continents
                            in water (which also happens to be predicted by various foretellers).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm no physics professor but seeing how our fusion startups a building ever more powerful
                            magnets and having seen a video of a frog being stabilized in air by a magnetic field (back
                            in last century if I remember) I imagine that the gravitational (and thus thermal) effect
                            should be minimized by a strong magnetic field, which could be applied to the surface of the
                            planet. It's hard to image such a large field being generated until you consider that
                            machines, perhaps larger that Earth (maye build over millions of years, with fuel reservoirs
                            big enough to generate such fields for days if not weeks at a time) could both move the
                            planet externally and secure it in a magnetic field internally. All it would take is 3 such
                            machines, correctly positioned around the planet to do the job. <b id="EMF-Shield">Update
                                5/16</b> One also has to think about the effects of electro-magnetic radiation from such
                            powerful magnetic fields. So additional equipment would be needed, something like a
                            temporary sleeve (probably of low density and weight) capable of preventing the deadly
                            effects of radiation (that would otherwise be applied to the surface of the planet). Also,
                            such a shield can also act as a thermal blanket to prevent excessive cooling of the Earth
                            due to lack of exposure to sunlight (caused by the blanket itself).
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Update 5/16 evening</b>
                            To deploy such a shield can be folded into a thin (orange peel like) slice and deployed at
                            night over the Pacific. Then (as the night rolls over the surface of the planet) it can be
                            expanded until it forms a full dome.  In the same exact way it can then be collapsed and
                            evacuated once all of the moving procedures are complete.  With this variant, it makes sense
                            for the duration of "the night" to be about half moon cycle and for it to start  about a
                            week before, and end about a week after the full event date (assuming the key event date is
                            August 16th).  This is because it's very convenient to hide the shield behind the Moon
                            (until the latest possible moment) until the Moon is close to the morning phase and remove
                            it (as soon as possible) when it reaches the evening phase. <b>Update 5/18</b> Deployment of
                            the EMF shield deployment with the tie-in to the Moon cycle doesn't seem right and is well
                            beyond my ability to provide an explanation of how exactly this could happen (using
                            techniques that we know are possible). Perhaps it does make sense for the deployment and
                            removal of the shield to happen in sunlight (while over the Pacific - the least populated
                            region of the planet) reducing the chances of accidental exposure to superior technological
                            capabilities.
                        </p>

                            Of course this gets even harder if you are trying to keep a (relatively) technologically
                            primitive civilization "in the dark" on the whole process, and prevent irreversible stunting
                            of its growth. This is where the New Moon would come in, combined with another factor - a
                            very big and long solar flare. A solar flare big enough (much bigger and longer than the one
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_solar_storms">observed in 1582</a>) would do
                            a number of things to blind observers on the surface
                            of the Earth. First it would cause Aurora lights which would obscure the view of the night
                            sky (the only time when we can really see anything anyway). It would also completely knock
                            out all of our imaging satellites, though those point towards the planet anyway. And, it
                            would knock out everything that is on the electric grid, with the grid acting as a huge
                            antenna, amplifying the EMP effect. Devices that aren't hooked in might also be rendered
                            useless (at least for the duration of the flare). On top of this, one could imagine very
                            advanced camouflage technology used to hide huge machines needed for the job. And, if you
                            believe that travel is possible in both time and space, the same (highly accurate by the
                            standards of foretellers) Baba Vanga also predicted a huge solar flare this year (which is
                            easy to believe since we are due for a new Solar maximum at any time and big flares do
                            happen occasionally). She also predicted the whole world being in darkness (which can be
                            explained by nearly complete and planet wide outages of electrical infrastructure, or if
                            taken literally by manipulation of atmosphere to cause a darkening effect, <b>Update
                                5/16</b> or the deployment of the above mentioned EMF sleeve). Of course, if you've been
                            preparing for this specific event for thousands of years you wouldn't leave the occurrence
                            of a one in a million years solar flare to chance and properly set off a force big enough to
                            cause it (for a long enough time).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the meantime, while Venus is obscured from view by the Moon's shadow, you could do
                            similar manipulations on that planet but without as many magnetic field precautions, since
                            it would be actually beneficial to reduce the thickness of the atmosphere there (<b>Update
                                5/16</b> again, if its known that there is no life, especially intelligent life, under
                            the surface of the planet). And when you combine the inertia of the inner 6 planets with
                            additionally applied force, the Venus and Earth could really move away from the Sun and
                            maybe even continue to do so by inertia and additional gravitational pull of outer gas
                            giants that will be in the right place to do so.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Update 5/27</b>
                            It may be that the Earth side of the operation is really more about stabilizing Earth orbit
                            more than moving the planet to make sure that no wobble effect (or anything alike) happens
                            due to Venus moving. Moving Venus by itself can be more quietly done when that planet is on
                            the other side of the Sun (from Earth), but, maintaining stability across the two planets is
                            easier done when you can lock their relative position and ensure that they stay stable
                            relative to each other.

                            Such (in every way convenient) planetary (and Solar cycle) alignments don't happen too
                            often, making this late August and September a prime and rare candidate for such
                            movements. I was really scratching my head on how the whole process would work until I saw
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPXM9TdyJRU">the alignment of the planets</a>
                            for my own.

                            In the what seems like an extremely unlikely case (as I sit in my peaceful and familiar
                            kitchen) that this scenario takes place I pray to the omnipresent creator of the Universe
                            that the chaos and suffering caused by such an event, along with our inability to stop
                            warring among each other (and recently depleted morale and resources) won't be an
                            excuse for a splinter group to make a beach head of one the two remote yet large and
                            resource rich regions of the world, in a proclaimed attempt to restore order and bring
                            peace. I also pray that no asteroids fall on Earth (by whatever means) and cause widespread
                            damage, as has also been foretold for this year.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Above all, I believe that it is up to the human (in the greater sense of the word) to decide
                            the outcome of events in God's Universe and no matter what has been foretold previously even
                            the slightest of
                            positive actions can change the course of events for the better, at all and any time. I
                            trust in the Lord and hope this information will find anyone and everyone that needs it (be
                            it many people or no one).

                        <p>
                            So, dear reader, I write this not in the hopes of scaring the living bejesus out of you, but
                            in the hopes of morally and psychologically preparing you, in the case this does happen.
                            When I first started thinking about this deeply a month and a half ago, I was scared of
                            everything, without a clear understanding of What it was and How it would happen (and that's
                            while I was already well prepared on the Why this would happen). I can only imagine what you
                            would think if you were hit with (still not completely mitigated and) very large tidal
                            effects, unstopping rains that pour for weeks and flood all low lying areas, night skies
                            completely blocked by all encompassing redness, knocked out electrical infrastructure (thank
                            God that if this happens in August most of the population will be in the warm period of the
                            year) and everything that relies on steady supply of electricity. And God forbid you (and
                            pretty much everyone else on the planet) see a glimpse of poorly camouflaged (during light
                            changing conditions of morning and evening) and enormous machine over your head (perhaps
                            fixed in a geo-stationary orbit, at a place where it would cause the least tidal and
                            tectonic movement). If you were completely unprepared, you could lose all trust in
                            everything you knew all of your life and contribute to the chaos that would probably be
                            happening in your (most likely) highly populated area. And, while I hope we get at least
                            another half of millenia of technological advancements before we come face to face with a
                            far more advanced civilization, I want us to be prepared for any premature and stunting
                            encounter, now more than ever.
                        </p>

                        <p><b>Update 7/26</b> updated the event date back to August 16th (with likely detection
                            capability disabling starting on 14th-15th). In light of recent findings (some of which
                            I prefer not to write about publically) I'm upgrading the likelihood of this scenario all
                            the way up to 70%-80% percent. We've (perhaps very predictably and understandably) messed
                            up quite a bit and a move is certainly necessary, the question is - are our times the
                            times to do it. If we are expected to start growing a spine 16.08.2,023 seems a
                            perfectly appropriate date to produce an incentive to do so ...
                        <p>
                        <p><b>Update 7/26</b> I pray to the Lord about everyone I have the right to pray for and wish to
                            everyone that may they be alive, whole and undamaged, healthy, live a long and happy life.
                             Everything points to the fact that we won't be able to pull off long term survival without
                            such a move of our planet (and we absolutely must start building an organization that will
                            provide a spine to build upon later) and when such an event does occur may we be out of
                            harm's way. I trust in people who are planning this and trust them to do the right thing if
                            and when the time comes.
                        <p><b>Update 8/16</b> We are now (and will be for the next few days) in the period of time that
                            presents the best conditions for commencement of "The Night", with the Moon not generating
                            any light at night. As I understand it, waiting for another month doesn't make sense because
                            by then the north of the Earth (where most of the landmass is) will be significantly cooler.
                            Perhaps the Greenhouse effect achieved by the hypothesized EMF blanket would maintain the
                            temperature high enough even during the colder September-October time period but my initial
                            reaction is that now is the time for the foretold events to come true or not. Afterall the
                            symbolic alignment of Earth, Moon and Venus with the Sun is likely a very rare occurrence
                            and we are experiencing it right now.</p>
                        <p><b>Update 8/16</b> With the likely time of the movement event upon us and no significant
                            solar flare yet to happen I am now thinking that the superior forces performing the move
                            have no need for one. Perhaps a crippling solar flare would be associated with a sneak
                            attack of a much less capable force that could use the post-move withdrawal of the superior
                            forces as a window of opportunity to do a resource grab run.</p>

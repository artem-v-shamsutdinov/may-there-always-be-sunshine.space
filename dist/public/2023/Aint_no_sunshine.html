                            In a few words as possible here is what I'm thinking about
                            <a href="./Coming_in_on_a_Wing_and_a_Prayer.html">this seemingly far fetched scenario:</a>
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Scenarios
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Best case scenario - the whole thing goes off without a hitch, the populous is not
                                alerted and we get another ~.5K of development and are not permantently stunted.
                                One would think that there is no better solution that producing a mass disinformation
                                campain. At least at first it looks like the only thing that would work is utilize
                                mass media to best effect to keep orbit change as a experts only, near
                                non-event (very slight changes, we are working on figuring it out, but in the mean
                                time - Look! ... And how about them Rams?) Just gotta be well thought out and
                                believable. But after I've given it some tought I'm sure that the best thing to
                                do is to say nothing and show that we can be a man. Scientists are smart guys
                                and will see if politicians are non-verbally showing belief that we need more time
                                to come out strong and stand on our own feet, with a lasting resolve to not give in
                                or give up. I trully believe that if we are to survive
                                long term we must be helping others not only to survive "in our parent's guest house"
                                but also be ready to help others beyond the neighboorhood with a profession
                                of our own choosing, instead of having the mentality of the poor child while
                                we are growing up.

                                Show organization and unity - that reduces the overall level of stress on all sides and
                                reduces chances of technical mess-ups on their side

                                Be prepared for a splinter group invasion - large operations require major cooperation
                                for many sides, number of parties capable of taking advantage of this is unknown (most
                                likely not directly or at all related to the superior forces that will be performing the
                                move, probably not the same civilization) - assuming around 100. Thatâ€™s a lot of
                                policing to do, chances of everything being fully controlled are not extremely high.

                        <p>
                            At the risk of coming through like a complete jerk who has no faith - I cannot help but
                            think of the one precious resource that is available in space-ready form,
                            owned by a non-major power. A power that is
                            geographically isolated from all but it's northern neighbor and has been blessed with many
                            mineral resources. A power that is spread out over a long strip of land where any
                            primite retaliatory attack would only affect a limited part of it, while doing massive
                            damage to the overall environment. A power that (God forbid) could (seamingly) be wiped out
                            in a blink of an eye with a massive tsunami.
                        </p>
                        <p>The worst is that I have no way of judging the likelihood of a bad actor scenario. Water
                            and resources are not readily available on Venus but what type of organization would be
                            willing to do massive (though perhaps arguably limited) damage to a child civilization? I
                            pray that we all remember that human (in the greater sense of the word) life is above all
                            price and must not be sacrificed. But we must be prepared to defend ourselves.
                            Swiftly and decisively.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Family</h2>
                        <p>
                            Perhaps the most difficult scenario to deal with would be that of a small (in terms of an
                            advanced civilization, perhaps around a million) group of colonists desperate to escape a
                            tough situation (not willing to tough it out due to unbearable conditions of the situation,
                            perhaps due to health related issues of their children). These could be backed by a battle
                            hardened force with a position of moral superiority in their actions. In such a situation it
                            will be critical for us to demonstrate that we are not the heartless savages they are likely
                            expecting us to be. It will likely come down to field level decisions and I pray that our
                            forces will put honor and integrity as the deciding factors in their actions.

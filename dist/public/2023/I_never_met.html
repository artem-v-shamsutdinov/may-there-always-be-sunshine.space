                        <p>
                            The initial
                            <a href="./Aint_no_sunshine.html">reflections</a> on a
                            <a href="./Coming_in_on_a_Wing_and_a_Prayer.html">possible scenario</a>
                            are leading me to the following train of thought:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The scenario of setting up a resource colony seems like the most likely one.  This is
                            probably the only way to ensure long term flow of resources.  We ourselves have gone through
                            a number of variants of extracting resources from colonies.  All were and (and still,
                            virtually are) bloody and placed us in an inferior (low ground) position.  By far the most
                            successful one took place in North America, with (God driven) migration of highly moral and
                            highly motivated small groups of colonists (with families).  A distant second is
                            the Australian variant, with forced labor of convicts.  These are most likely the two
                            scenarios we are likely facing, in the overall splinter group scenario.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A decision center in a highly moral advanced civilization will most likely limit the success
                            of the colonization based on outcomes in their (likely much longer) recorded history. My
                            hunch is that the forced
                            labor scenario is more likely but it is imossible to rule out a more impulsive scenario of
                            a desperate group of colonists - mostly peaceful and well meaning civilians. Even with the
                            convict scenario the quality of (non shock force) labor will be well above
                            our general population due to (very highley likely) advanced correction technology and
                            techniques - they (most likely) lagely wouldn't be hostile (again barring the shock force).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With the family groups scenario the likely outcome is the spread first across the continent
                            and then possibly North (though that appears to be a defensible position).  A total New
                            World
                            scenario is possible as well but is less likely due to lower moral grounds.  Though
                            disabling capability can be justified if a (relatively) peaceful group of colonists is wiped
                            out in an initial retaliatory attack (may God forbid such a scenario - it doesn't take a
                            general to understand that in such a course of
                            events we have to show discipline and react symmetrically, prioritizing civilian life).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The scenario of a penal colony appears to be more manageble in the long term, with possible
                            decolonization once the flow of resources is automated, agreed upon by locals, and properly
                            supervised.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next question then arises - what is the best way to avoid such scenarios.  Given that
                            the most logical reason for colonization is extraction of resources, perhaps a deal can be
                            struck to supply the needed resources a la UAE scenario at first. Subsequently likely best
                            outcome would be properly paced industrialization, a la late 20th century China, barring
                            exessive centralization. My take is that the most important thing is to develop our own
                            technological and industrial base, without being put on an external growth catalyst.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Taking this course of action could potentially be justified by the outcome of the blackout
                            scenario, stating that we need to build space infrastructure (to explain the event and
                            prepare for the future). Primarily a <a href="https://www.isec.org/who-we-are">space
                                elevator</a> (at the easiest possible point - Galapagos), which will allow steady flow
                            of resources first to orbit and then beyond.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As history has shown, large construction projects usually pay off.  I would add that this
                            should be done in a need-to-know way to prevent growth stunting (to allow development of
                            our own technological base and winner mentality).  This means that likely the only way to
                            accomplish this is a (slow but steady) merger of global industrial capacities and
                            organization of a self-defence force, a la orbital version of starfleet.  Any ventures
                            beyond Earth Orbit must be controlled until the next big move.
                        </p>

                            With this article I would like to finish writing on (and thinking deeply about) this topic -
                            may the Lord help us if such a scenario takes place.
                        </p>

                                likely concurrent resource extraction over Antarctica, especially if an expectation
                                exists of a future resource extraction agreement - they don't necessarily need it now
                                but now is the most convenient time to do quick, large scale extractions).

                                To put this in perspective, I remember watching a state television broadcast during the
                                fall of the Soviet Union. They showed a sizable (<b>Added: 1/17/2025</b> cigar shaped) UFO over a large Siberian city. It was
                                there long enough to make it to the national news. Funny thing, the reporters
                                specifically stated: "Nobody is looking up.". The news show went on to more pressing
                                (<b>Added: 1/17/2025</b> and technologically calming) issues, and didn't make a big deal of the situation.

                            <p>
                                Would there be more chaos in the streets if there was no light or warmth from the Sun
                                for a week, or, if there was a faint outline of a nearly invisible (probably triangular
                                as the bottom of a tetrahedron, with top used for refueling entry) shape overhead? Would
                                we "Keep calm and carry on" if we were sufficiently prepared for the situation? Would we
                                be able to let it all go and focus on technological advancement, instead of going all
                                religious as a result of fear of the unknown in prolonged total darkness?

                        <p>
                            The galagraphy around us is an order of magnitude more complex than the geography here on
                            Earth. Many hundreds of light years worth of stars surround our relatively central location
                            in the Galaxy. If we are to make an assumption that the galaxy has been continuously
                            populated by sentient races for billions of years before us (up to now) then one could make
                            some assumptions about how the power is distributed between various regional centers. I have
                            absolutely no data to base this on but using my imagination gives me a picture in which
                            there are 10 to 12 regional centers that control the bulk of the galaxy. From that I
                            logically derive that there might be 3 to 4 higher order powers that make their presence
                            known when necessary but mostly stay of the of the way in order not to stifle development
                            of younger races that would otherwise be left powerless in the face of overwhelming
                            (perhaps cross galactic) capabilities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is also logical to assume that the regional centers provide overall direction to more
                            recent local centers and actively provide peace and order in their region. In my imagination
                            these are the "grandfather" races. Likely the regional centers are mostly concerned with
                            galactic matters and the local centers are in charge of bringing new-born races and
                            organizing order between lesser (but already space faring) races. The local centers are
                            "father" races in my mind. And all of the lesser races are "cousins" of various ages and
                            productive capacities. And it appears logical to me that it takes time, LOTS of time, to
                            move up the ladder on which we are not yet present.

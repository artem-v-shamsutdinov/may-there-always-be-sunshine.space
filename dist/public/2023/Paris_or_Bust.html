                            The more I think about it the more the scenario of organizing
                            <a href="../2023/I_never_met.html">
                                an international orbital fleet</a> looks appealing. With such
                            an organization we would both have a unified self-defence force and a
                            direct channel of cooperation between major militaries of the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course its capabilities would be extremely limited compared to the far
                            more advanced competition (that already has the technology to get here from
                            wherever they might be coming from). But we don't need as much capability
                            to begin with - we just need to show that we have the whole planet under
                            control (or at least its land surface). And that control is exercised
                            without bias toward one region or another.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And, certainly, it will take time to build such an organization. It will
                            most likely have to start small (in terms of staff count and budget),
                            with the main building project being the space elevator (to deliver
                            materials and goods to orbit). It probably will take several decades
                            (perhaps half a century) to build this organization up to a capable fighting force. At
                            first it won't be much more than a coordination center between the two
                            primary powers that have the (nuclear) potential to secure the world.
                            The ground control would (perhaps always) be exercised by national
                            forces but overtime the control of orbital space would be shifted to
                            this "Orbfleet".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Such an organization would have to be headquartered in a country
                            that is neutral to all major powers on the planet. And this place
                            will have to be a major polit-economical and cultural center so that
                            it doesn't fall under the influence of any of these major powers. Of
                            course, I can't think of a better place for Orbfleet headquarters
                            than Paris, France.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First of all, as a result of the outcome of World War II, France is
                            a permanent member of the security council. United Kingdom is the
                            only other member of the council that isn't a major power and it's
                            under heavy influence of the USA. France has its own nuclear arsenal
                            and "remains the only NATO member outside the Nuclear Planning
                            Group and unlike the United States and the United Kingdom, will not
                            commit its nuclear-armed submarines to the alliance". It has a
                            sizable military and its own military-industrial complex.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            France also has strategically significant islands in the Pacific,
                            Indian and North Atlantic oceans. It
                            provides military coverage for most of Western Africa and
                            hosts the European space port in South America.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The other critical factor that makes France the prime candidate
                            is its cultural heritage. Culture is the key component to
                            our long term survival. Not
                            only do we have to remember our evolutionary heritage (vs other
                            myths of more recent beginnings) but we also must show cultural
                            refinement and most importantly beauty. I truly believe that the
                            saying "beauty will save the world" is correct.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            French culture is renowned throughout the world and is considered
                            very appealing. It's capital Paris is the most
                            beautiful city on the planet and hosts Louvre, the biggest art
                            museum we have. Everybody dreams of visiting Paris at least
                            once in their lifetimes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In terms of political culture, France maintains its
                            pan-European ambitions (that go as far as building a greater
                            European community, including Russia) with a strong will.
                            As the burning of the Notre-Dame roof (and subsequent raising
                            of funds to rebuild it) has shown it has unity of the masses
                            with the elites when it comes to the most important questions.
                            Yet at the same time its proletariat is the most conscious in
                            the world and has successfully defended the retirement age
                            and is doing so again as I'm writing this post.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And, very symbolically, the Eiffel tower (which was the
                            tallest structure on the planet for 41 years after a long
                            period of dominance of the Egyptian Pyramids) looks like
                            a ground anchor of a space elevator.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All in all, I can't think of a better place to headquarter
                            the communication center of the future orbital self-defence
                            force than Paris, France.

                            Of course the main concern one would probably bring up when thinking of a scenario of a
                            unified security cap would be fascism.  Well fascism is an ideology of total warfare in
                            order to ensure long term survival and prosperity.   And given the assumptions made in this
                            series there will always be someone bigger than us with more productive capacity and
                            overwhelming force.  Warring to take away somebody else's territory simply won't
                            realistically be an option for us since there we would then risk losing (at least a part of)
                            our own Motherland as a corrective measure.  And I am a firm believer that our galaxy is
                            full of valiant people that are in the service of younger races - some even willing to blow
                            away into the darkness to change the course of things, if we don't get enough driven
                            galactic citizens to prevent the impending catastrophe:

                            Fascism is a form of total organization of a society to achieve a greater (albeit a
                            horrible) goal (of course I'm not even touching Nazism which went to the ultimate extreme to
                            unify a society thus ensuring the failure of its original goal) . Fascism without a goal of
                            total warfare is not. No ideology is required if what you are trying to do is increase

                            While general institualization of social protest in Europe may be great in general, the
                            political nature of the protest of the masses common to France would serve as perhaps the
                            biggest psychological deterrent to Fascist trends within the budding Orbfleet organization,
                            if it were to be headquartered in Paris.

                            France is not without its issues of course but in the present conditions it appears to be
                            the most logical place to host the headquarters.  Perhaps in the eons to come the role of a
                            coordination center is best filled by several centers, strategically positioned in multiple
                            locations around the globe. Perhaps starting with 3 in the upper North of the planet (which
                            can be organized into a cohesive unit faster than the entirety of the planet) as early as
                            the second half of this century and eventually making it to perhaps 7 redundant centers
                            around the globe.  But, for the time being, what better place can be proposed to get
                            started?

                            <b>Update 8/30</b> Irrespective of the assumptions made in this series, our society continues
                            advancing technologically. To support this advancement we need ever increasing amounts of
                            rare minerals and scarce metals. Soon enough we'll be running out of the places where we can
                            mine them and soon enough we'll start looking at the nearby asteroids for needed resources.
                            Metallic asteroids are relatively rare but there is a huge field to choose from. Once the
                            needed resources become scarce enough it will be a matter of cost. And once the space
                            elevator technology is implemented the "the slingshot to space" (likely
                            orders of magnitude cheaper and safer than rockets) combined with nuclear fusion
                            will make the endeavor of space resource extraction economically sound. Not
                            long after that there will be a need for "Pax Terra" to ensure resource flow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even more importantly, once there are enough parties in orbital space the threat of
                            orbit-to-ground kinetic
                            attack will become a major concern (especially with trajectories of ever-growing earth bound
                            asteroids). With de-globalization in effect it is highly unlikely that any one
                            regional power center will be able to provide orbital
                            security for the entire planet. Unless we think ahead and start acting now, certainly 50
                            (and I would argue 25) years from now we will need to catch up our security infrastructure
                            to our industrial infrastructure. Acting now will ensure our safety in the coming asteroid
                            age
                            and provide security for many more additional functionalities besides resource extraction.

                            The first group of Space Elevators (positioned in close proximity due to favorable physics
                            of the Galapagos) will be the "Lifeline to Space". It's security
                            by anything less than a planetary organization will likely put it at risk of in-orbit
                            severance, which is easy to do and cover up. Tackling the construction and security of
                            Space Elevators as a "single-voiced" Planet is the logical solution.

                            What gives me joy is the fact that in the process of setting up unified control of orbital
                            space we'll also limit general in-orbit hostilities. I hope that such scale of cooperation
                            in space will lead to less armed conflict here on Earth and hopefully will eliminate
                            large-scale combat altogether - <b>Update 9/4</b> will end War.

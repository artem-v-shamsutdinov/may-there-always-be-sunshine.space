                            The more I think about it the more the scenario of organizing
                            <a href="../2023/I_never_met.html">
                                an international orbital fleet</a> looks appealing. With such
                            an organization we would both have a unified self-defence force and a
                            direct channel of cooperation between major militaries of the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course its capabilities would be extremely limited compared to the far
                            more advanced competition (that already has the technology to get here from
                            wherever they might be coming from). But we don't need as much capability
                            to begin with - we just need to show that we have the whole planet under
                            control (or at least its land surface). And that control is exercised
                            without bias toward one region or another.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And, certainly, it will take time to build such an organization. It will
                            most likely have to start small (in terms of staff count and budget),
                            with the main building project being the space elevator (to deliver
                            materials and goods to orbit). It probably will take several decades
                            (perhaps half a century) to build this organization up to a capable fighting force. At
                            first it won't be much more than a coordination center between the two
                            primary powers that have the (nuclear) potential to secure the world.
                            The ground control would (perhaps always) be exercised by national
                            forces but overtime the control of orbital space would be shifted to
                            this "Orbfleet".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Such an organization would have to be headquartered in a country
                            that is neutral to all major powers on the planet. And this place
                            will have to be a major polit-economical and cultural center so that
                            it doesn't fall under the influence of any of these major powers. Of
                            course, I can't think of a better place for Orbfleet headquarters
                            than Paris, France.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First of all, as a result of the outcome of World War II, France is
                            a permanent member of the security council. United Kingdom is the
                            only other member of the council that isn't a major power and it's
                            under heavy influence of the USA. France has its own nuclear arsenal
                            and "remains the only NATO member outside the Nuclear Planning
                            Group and unlike the United States and the United Kingdom, will not
                            commit its nuclear-armed submarines to the alliance". It has a
                            sizable military and its own military-industrial complex.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            France also has strategically significant islands in the Pacific,
                            Indian and North Atlantic oceans. It
                            provides military coverage for most of Western Africa and
                            hosts the European space port in South America.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The other critical factor that makes France the prime candidate
                            is its cultural heritage. Culture is the key component to
                            our long term survival. Not
                            only do we have to remember our evolutionary heritage (vs other
                            myths of more recent beginnings) but we also must show cultural
                            refinement and most importantly beauty. I truly believe that the
                            saying "beauty will save the world" is correct.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            French culture is renowned throughout the world and is considered
                            very appealing. It's capital Paris is the most
                            beautiful city on the planet and hosts Louvre, the biggest art
                            museum we have. Everybody dreams of visiting Paris at least
                            once in their lifetimes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In terms of political culture, France maintains its
                            pan-European ambitions (that go as far as building a greater
                            European community, including Russia) with a strong will.
                            As the burning of the Notre-Dame roof (and subsequent raising
                            of funds to rebuild it) has shown it has unity of the masses
                            with the elites when it comes to the most important questions.
                            Yet at the same time its proletariat is the most conscious in
                            the world and has successfully defended the retirement age
                            and is doing so again as I'm writing this post.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And, very symbolically, the Eiffel tower (which was the
                            tallest structure on the planet for 41 years after a long
                            period of dominance of the Egyptian Pyramids) looks like
                            a ground anchor of a space elevator.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All in all, I can't think of a better place to headquarter
                            the communication center of the future orbital self-defence
                            force than Paris, France.
                        </p>
